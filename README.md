# GPU-Switch-Optimus

An Optimus PC typically refers to a computer that incorporates NVIDIA Optimus technology. NVIDIA Optimus is a technology designed to dynamically switch between two graphics processors (integrated and dedicated) based on the workload and power requirements. The goal is to provide better performance when needed while still preserving energy efficiency for tasks that don't require high graphics processing power.

With Debian Linux OS, the seamless switching between integrated and dedicated graphics is no longer done automatically by the Optimus technology, requiring user intervention. 

The following is a hardware configuration script: specifically written to simplify alternating between graphic processors.

Requires Debian Linux OS & Nvidia Optimus technology.

Dependencies include:
os, sys
